# assessment
Formal assessment of state-of-the-science atmospheric simulation methodologies within the Atmosphere-to-Electrons (a2e) mesoscale-to-microscale coupling (MMC) project

The contents of this repository include:
- Demonstration of our data processing and analysis procedures--separated into data standardization, calculation, and plotting steps--in the form of Jupyter notebooks
- High-level python code to accomplish the aforementioned tasks

See the `dev` branch for the latest work in progress.

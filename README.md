# assessment
Formal assessment of state-of-the-science atmospheric simulation methodologies within the Atmosphere-to-Electrons (a2e) mesoscale-to-microscale coupling (MMC) project

The contents of this repository include:

- **Examples** of our data processing and analysis procedures--separated into data standardization, analysis, and plotting steps--in the form of Jupyter notebooks
- **High-level python code** to accomplish the aforementioned tasks
- **Standardized datasets** from observations and simulations, ready for use in our analyses
- **MMC studies** that utilize these datasets

The structure of this repository (and the parent `a2e-mmc` organization) is as follows:

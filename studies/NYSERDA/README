This directory contains all scripts necessary for downloading auxiliary SST files, overwriting
SST in met_em files, and analyzing the WRF results for the NYSERDA test suite. To set up the 
NYSERDA cases, use the scripts found in the a2e-mmc/WRF-Setups github repo.

1. To download SST, the scripts rely on a NASA-JPL data archive. Unfortunately, this archive has
changed since the original datasets were downloaded so the new scripts are only working for a few
of the SST datasets. Regardless, to download what you can, follow the steps within
https://github.com/podaac/data-subscriber to install the necessary codes and set up an account
with Earthdata. Then, the script, SST/DownloadSST_new.py, will download the necessary files.

The GOES-16 gap-filled SST data was collected via personal communication with Mike Optis and 
Stephanie Redfern at NREL.

2. For overwriting SST on met_em files, make sure that you have run the base case through
WPS so that there are met_em files to overwrite. With the location of the met_em files and
the auxiliary SST datasets, the script, NYSERDA_OverwriteSST.py, will be used to create 
new met_em files for the simulation suite.

3. After the new SST datasets are made, return to the setup script in WRF-Setups and run to
create the rest of the cases.

4. Run all cases to completion.

5. The analysis depends on extracted data from wrfout files. Run ExtractWRFOUTdata.py to get
the extracted data from each case.

6. Analysis is then performed within the LES_Extract_Compare.ipynb notebook
